### Why did I make this?
Currently, I am in an environment where I am not allowed to install anything on my desktop for some security reason.

When using my toy aws ec2 instance, shellinabox was super useful because it gave secure remote shell access with no client-side installation.

But I could not find any simple tool that gave secure remote file control with no client-side installation.

So I forked off SimpleHTTPServerWithUpload written by bones7456 to make this tool.

I use this everyday in addition to shellinabox to have full control over my aws instance, and it's super convenient.

###How To Install
Read and edit settings.py.

`sudo ./install`

Once the script is completed, this file server should be registered as an upstart service.

###How To Uninstall
`sudo ./uninstall`

###Credit
This is a fork of http://li2z.cn/?s=SimpleHTTPServerWithUpload written by bones7456 (who also forked from http://www.opensource.apple.com/source/python/python-3/python/Lib/SimpleHTTPServer.py)

This fork basically adds install scripts, authentication, and some more on top of the original code that supports directory browse and file upload.
